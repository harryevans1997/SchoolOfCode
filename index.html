        <h2 id="headline">Below shows the life of J. C. Maxwell's and his accomplishments:</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>1831:</strong> Born in Edinburgh.</li>
          <li><strong>1846:</strong> Wrote his first scientific paper at age 14.
          <li><strong>1847:</strong> Began at the University of Edinburgh at age 16.
          <li><strong>1849:</strong> Contributed two more papers, one of them paving the way to an important discovery he found later in life.
          <li><strong>1850:</strong> After finishing his studies in Edinburgh, Maxwell left Scotland to attend Cambridge University.
          <li><strong>1851:</strong> Maxwell begins studying Mathematics under William Hopkins.
          <li><strong>1854:</strong> Graduated with the title of Second Wrangler (second-highest score in final examination) and received the Smith's Prize.
          <li><strong>1855:</strong> Contributed a paper detailing the principles of colour combination. Was made a fellow of Trinity and began lecturing on
    hydrostatics and optics.
          <li><strong>1856:</strong> Left Cambridge to accept a professorship in Aberdeen.
          <li><strong>1859:</strong> Submitted a theory describing the composition of Saturns' Rings which he was awarded the 1859 Adams Prize 
    and £130 (~£17,000)
          <li><strong>1858:</strong> Married to Katherine Mary
          <li><strong>1860:</strong> Recovered from a near-fatal case of smallpox. He was laid off as a professor at the newly formed University of Aberdeen
    and found himself accepting the Chair of Natural Philosiphy at King's College, London. Early into his time here, he was awarded
    the Rumford Medal for his work on colour.
          <li><strong>1861:</strong> Elected into the Royal Society. Derived the equations that unified electricity and magnetism in his paper "On Physical
    Lines of Force". Presented the world's first demonstration of colour photography.
          <li><strong>1865:</strong> Before resigning his position at King's College London, he proved that light travels as an electromagnetic 
    wave in his paper "A Dynamical Theory of the Electromagnetic Field", a discovery that later paves the way for Einstein's 
    Special Theory of Relativity.
          <li><strong>1866-1871:</strong> Published multiple papers contributing to Control Theory, Thermodynamics and Colour Theory.
          <li><strong>1871:</strong> Returned to Cambridge to become the first Cavendish Professor of Physics.
          <li><strong>1879:</strong> Died of abdominal cancer at the age of 48.
        </ul>
